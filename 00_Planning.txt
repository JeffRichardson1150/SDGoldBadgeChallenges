Software Development Gold Badge Project Sprint Plan

What needs to be completed by the due date? (e.g. how many console apps and what is required)


What does the architecture of the all applications need to include? 
	(e.g Repository Layer, UI Layer, Unit Tests, etc.)

Have you created a GitHub repository for the application?

What is the prompt requesting to be built? 
	(summarize what the console app will do) 

What type of collection should you utilize for the application requested by the prompt?

What methods do you need to create the functionality the prompt is requesting?  
	(e.g A method to Add an object to a dictionary, 
	A method to Delete an object from a queue, 
	a method to check if the user typed yes or no) 

Create a schedule for the next week for when you will complete each console application/or what functionality for the apps you will complete each day. 


Day 1 - Monday

Day 3 - Wednesday
